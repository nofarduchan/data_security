# data_security - Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)

Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is an advanced cryptographic protocol for secure key exchange, based on elliptic curve principles. This protocol significantly improves upon the traditional Diffie-Hellman method, providing a higher level of security while using shorter keys. This advantage makes ECDH particularly efficient for resource-constrained systems, such as mobile devices and IoT applications.
ECDH is one of the most important algorithms in modern cryptography due to its unique combination of high security and computational efficiency. The algorithm enables two parties to securely generate a shared encryption key, even when communicating over an insecure channel, without exposing critical information to a third party.
One of the key characteristics of ECDH is its reliance on the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). This mathematical problem is considered exceptionally difficult and serves as the foundation for ECDH’s strong resistance against modern cryptanalytic attacks. Furthermore, the use of shorter keys not only improves efficiency but also reduces memory and processing requirements, making ECDH ideal for a wide range of applications.

Running the project:
- Download all the attached libraries.
- First, run the server, which will wait for the client to run.
- Run the client.
- Verify that the key exchange was done correctly by checking the output.
- Run the test file to ensure that the code implements the ECDH protocol.
